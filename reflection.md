- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    My inital impression is that I can definitely see how Encapsulation is an important concept in coding, particularly when you are working with bigger, collaborative, and more complex projects. When making a train, you wouldn't want a random outsider to be able to change something like the max capacity of a train car or the fuel type of the engine. However, being able to access and change certain variables from outside the class, like the number of passengers on a car or the current fuel level, was integral in making the other classes function correctly.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    As always, going to TA hours and asking professors/friends questions helped a lot in this project.
