- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    My initial impressions are that it doesn't affect my programming very much (at this stage). I understand that Encapsulation becomes much more of an important concept when we get to bigger, collaborative, and more complex projects, but not so much at the point we are at right now.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    As always, going to TA hours and asking professors/friends questions helped a lot in this project.
